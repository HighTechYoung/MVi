<p><b>Why is the Discrete Wavelet Transform Needed? <o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p>Although the discretized continuous wavelet transform enables the
computation of the continuous wavelet transform by computers, it is not a true
discrete transform. As a matter of fact, the wavelet series is simply a sampled
version of the CWT, and the information it provides is highly redundant as far
as the reconstruction of the signal is concerned. This redundancy, on the other
hand, requires a significant amount of computation time and resources. The
discrete wavelet transform (DWT), on the other hand, provides sufficient
information both for analysis and synthesis of the original signal, with a
significant reduction in the computation time.</p>

<p>The DWT is considerably easier to implement when compared to the CWT. The
basic concepts of the DWT will be introduced in this section along with its
properties and the algorithms used to compute it. As in the previous chapters,
examples are provided to aid in the interpretation of the DWT.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>THE DISCRETE WAVELET TRANSFORM (DWT) <o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The foundations of the DWT go back to 1976 when <span class="SpellE">Croiser</span>,
Esteban, and <span class="SpellE">Galand</span> devised a technique to decompose
discrete time signals. <span class="SpellE">Crochiere</span>, Weber, and Flanagan
did a similar work on coding of speech signals in the same year. They named
their analysis scheme as <span class="SpellE"><b>subband</b></span><b> coding</b>.
In 1983, Burt defined a technique very similar to <span class="SpellE">subband</span>
coding and named it <b>pyramidal coding</b> which is also known as
multiresolution analysis. Later in 1989, <span class="SpellE">Vetterli</span> and
Le Gall made some improvements to the <span class="SpellE">subband</span> coding
scheme, removing the existing redundancy in the pyramidal coding scheme. <span class="SpellE">Subband</span> coding is explained below. A detailed coverage of
the discrete wavelet transform and theory of multiresolution analysis can be
found in a number of articles and books that are available on this topic, and
it is beyond the scope of this tutorial. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>The <span class="SpellE">Subband</span> Coding and <span class="GramE">The</span>
Multiresolution Analysis <o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The main idea is the same as it is in the CWT. A time-scale representation
of a digital signal is obtained using digital filtering techniques. Recall that
the CWT is a correlation between a wavelet at different scales and the signal
with the scale (or the frequency) being used as a measure of similarity. The
continuous wavelet transform was computed by changing the scale of the analysis
window, shifting the window in time, multiplying by the signal, and integrating
over all times. In the discrete case, filters of different cutoff frequencies
are used to analyze the signal at different scales. The signal is passed
through a series of high pass filters to analyze the high frequencies, and it
is passed through a series of low pass filters to analyze the low frequencies.</p>

<p>The resolution of the signal, which is a measure of the amount of detail
information in the signal, is changed by the filtering operations, and the
scale is changed by upsampling and downsampling (<span class="SpellE">subsampling</span>)
operations. <span class="SpellE">Subsampling</span> a signal corresponds to
reducing the sampling rate, or removing some of the samples of the signal. For
example, <span class="SpellE">subsampling</span> by two refers to dropping every
other sample of the signal. <span class="SpellE">Subsampling</span> by a factor <i>n</i>
reduces the number of samples in the signal <i>n</i> times.</p>

<p>Upsampling a signal corresponds to increasing the sampling rate of a signal
by adding new samples to the signal. For example, upsampling by two refers to
adding a new sample, usually a zero or an <span class="GramE">interpolated</span>
value, between every two samples of the signal. Upsampling a signal by a factor
of <i>n</i> increases the number of samples in the signal by a factor of <i>n</i>.</p>

<p>Although it is not the only possible choice, DWT coefficients are usually
sampled from the CWT on a dyadic grid, i.e., s<sub>0</sub> = 2 and <span style="font-family:Symbol">t</span> <sub>0</sub> = 1, yielding s=2<sup>j</sup>
and <span style="font-family:Symbol">t</span> =k*2<sup>j</sup>, as described in
Part 3. Since the signal is a discrete time function, the terms function and
sequence will be used interchangeably in the following discussion. This
sequence will be denoted by x[n], where n is an integer.</p>

<p>The procedure starts with passing this signal (sequence) through a half band
digital lowpass filter with impulse response h[n]. Filtering a signal corresponds
to the mathematical operation of convolution of the signal with the impulse
response of the filter. The convolution operation in discrete time is defined
as follows:</p>

<p><img id="_x0000_i1026" src="Part4_files/Image10.gif" height="56" border="0" width="245"></p>

<p>A half band lowpass filter removes all frequencies that are above half of
the highest frequency in the signal. For example, if a signal has a maximum of
1000 Hz component, then half band lowpass filtering removes all the frequencies
above 500 Hz. </p>

<p>The unit of frequency is of particular importance at this time. In discrete
signals, frequency is expressed in terms of radians. Accordingly, the sampling
frequency of the signal is equal to 2<span style="font-family:Symbol">p</span>
radians in terms of radial frequency. Therefore, the highest frequency
component that exists in a signal will be <span style="font-family:Symbol">p</span>
radians, if the signal is sampled at <span class="SpellE">Nyquist�s</span> rate
(which is twice the maximum frequency that exists in the signal); that is, the <span class="SpellE">Nyquist�s</span> rate corresponds to <span style="font-family:
Symbol">p</span> <span class="SpellE">rad</span>/s in the discrete frequency
domain. Therefore using Hz is not appropriate for discrete signals. However, Hz
is used whenever it is needed to clarify a discussion, since it is very common
to think of frequency in terms of Hz. It should always be remembered that the
unit of frequency for discrete time signals is radians.</p>

<p>After passing the signal through a half band lowpass filter, half of the
samples can be eliminated according to the <span class="SpellE">Nyquist�s</span>
rule, since the signal now has a highest frequency of <span style="font-family:
Symbol">p</span>/2 radians instead of <span style="font-family:Symbol">p</span>
radians. Simply discarding every other sample will <span class="SpellE"><b>subsample</b></span>
the signal by two, and the signal will then have half the number of points. The
scale of the signal is now doubled. Note that the lowpass filtering removes the
high frequency information, but leaves the scale unchanged. Only the <span class="SpellE">subsampling</span> process changes the scale. Resolution, on the
other hand, is related to the amount of information in the signal, and
therefore, it is affected by the filtering operations. Half band lowpass
filtering removes half of the frequencies, which can be interpreted as losing
half of the information. Therefore, the resolution is halved after the
filtering operation. Note, however, the <span class="SpellE">subsampling</span>
operation after filtering does not affect the resolution, since removing half
of the spectral components from the signal makes half the number of samples
redundant anyway. Half the samples can be discarded without any loss of information.
In summary, the lowpass filtering halves the resolution, but leaves the scale
unchanged. The signal is then <span class="SpellE">subsampled</span> by 2 since
half of the <span class="GramE">number of samples are</span> redundant. This
doubles the scale. </p>

<p>This procedure can mathematically be expressed as</p>

<p><img id="_x0000_i1027" src="Part4_files/Image11.gif" height="56" border="0" width="209"></p>

<p>Having said that, we now look how the DWT is actually computed: The DWT
analyzes the signal at different frequency bands with different resolutions by
decomposing the signal into a coarse approximation and detail information. DWT
employs two sets of functions, called scaling functions and wavelet functions,
which are associated with low pass and highpass filters, respectively. The
decomposition of the signal into different frequency bands is simply obtained
by successive highpass and lowpass filtering of the time domain signal. The
original signal x[n] is first passed through a <span class="SpellE">halfband</span>
highpass filter g[n] and a lowpass filter h[n]. After the filtering, half of
the samples can be eliminated according to the <span class="SpellE">Nyquist�s</span>
rule, since the signal now has a highest frequency of <span style="font-family:
Symbol">p</span> /2 radians instead of <span class="GramE"><span style="font-family:Symbol">p</span> .</span> The signal can therefore be <span class="SpellE">subsampled</span> by 2, simply by discarding every other sample.
This constitutes one level of decomposition and can mathematically be expressed
as follows: </p>

<p><img id="_x0000_i1028" src="Part4_files/Image12.gif" height="93" border="0" width="228"></p>

<p><span class="GramE">where</span> <span class="SpellE">y<sub>high</sub></span>[k]
and <span class="SpellE">y<sub>low</sub></span>[k] are the outputs of the
highpass and lowpass filters, respectively, after <span class="SpellE">subsampling</span>
by 2. </p>

<p>This decomposition halves the time resolution since only half the number of
samples now characterizes the entire signal. However, this operation doubles
the frequency resolution, since the frequency band of the signal now spans only
half the previous frequency band, effectively reducing the uncertainty in the
frequency by half. The above procedure, which is also known as the <span class="SpellE">subband</span> coding, can be repeated for further decomposition.
At every level, the filtering and <span class="SpellE">subsampling</span> will
result in half the number of samples (and hence half the time resolution) and
half the frequency <span class="GramE">band spanned (and hence double</span> the
frequency resolution). Figure 4.1 illustrates this procedure, where x[n] is the
original signal to be decomposed, and h[n] and g[n] are lowpass and highpass
filters, respectively. The bandwidth of the signal at every level is marked on
the figure as "f". </p>

<p><img id="_x0000_i1029" src="Part4_files/Image13.gif" height="736" border="0" width="655"></p>

<p><span class="GramE">Figure 4.1.</span> The <span class="SpellE">Subband</span>
Coding Algorithm<b><i> </i></b>As an example, suppose that the original signal
x[n] has 512 sample points, spanning a frequency band of zero to <span style="font-family:Symbol">p</span> <span class="SpellE">rad</span>/s. At the
first decomposition level, the signal is passed through the highpass and
lowpass filters, followed by <span class="SpellE">subsampling</span> by 2. The
output of the highpass filter has 256 points (hence half the time resolution),
but it only spans the frequencies <span style="font-family:Symbol">p</span>/2
to <span style="font-family:Symbol">p</span> <span class="SpellE">rad</span>/s
(hence double the frequency resolution). These 256 samples constitute the first
level of DWT coefficients. The output of the lowpass filter also has 256
samples, but it spans the other half of the frequency band, frequencies from 0
to <span style="font-family:Symbol">p</span>/2 <span class="SpellE">rad</span>/s.
This signal is then passed through the same lowpass and highpass filters for
further decomposition. The output of the second lowpass filter followed by <span class="SpellE">subsampling</span> has 128 samples spanning a frequency band of 0
to <span style="font-family:Symbol">p</span>/4 <span class="SpellE">rad</span>/s,
and the output of the second highpass filter followed by <span class="SpellE">subsampling</span>
has 128 samples spanning a frequency band of <span style="font-family:Symbol">p</span>/4
to <span style="font-family:Symbol">p</span>/2 <span class="SpellE">rad</span>/s.
The second highpass filtered signal constitutes the second level of DWT
coefficients. This signal has half the time resolution, but twice the frequency
resolution of the first level signal. In other words, time resolution has
decreased by a factor of 4, and frequency resolution has increased by a factor
of 4 compared to the original signal. The lowpass filter output is then
filtered once again for further decomposition. This process continues until two
samples are left. For this specific example there would be 8 levels of decomposition,
each having half the number of samples of the previous level. The DWT of the
original signal is then obtained by concatenating all coefficients starting
from the last level of decomposition (remaining two samples, in this case). The
DWT will then have the same number of coefficients as the original signal. </p>

<p>The frequencies that are most prominent in the original signal will appear
as high amplitudes in that region of the DWT signal that includes those
particular frequencies. The difference of this transform from the Fourier
transform is that the time localization of these frequencies will not be lost.
However, the time localization will have a resolution that depends on which
level they appear. If the main information of the signal lies in the high frequencies,
as happens most often, the time localization of these frequencies will be more
precise, since they are characterized by more number of samples. If the main
information lies only at very low frequencies, the time localization will not
be very precise, since few samples are used to express signal at these
frequencies. This procedure in effect offers a good time resolution at high
frequencies, and good frequency resolution at low frequencies. Most practical
signals encountered are of this type. </p>

<p>The frequency bands that are not very prominent in the original signal will
have very low amplitudes, and that part of the DWT signal can be discarded
without any major loss of information, allowing data reduction. Figure 4.2
illustrates an example of how DWT signals look like and how data reduction is
provided. Figure 4.2a shows a typical 512-sample signal that is normalized to
unit amplitude. The horizontal axis is the number of samples, whereas the
vertical axis is the normalized amplitude. Figure 4.2b shows the 8 level DWT of
the signal in Figure 4.2a. The last 256 samples in this signal correspond to
the highest frequency band in the <span class="GramE">signal,</span> the previous
128 samples correspond to the second highest frequency band and so on. It
should be noted that only the first 64 samples, which correspond to lower
frequencies of the analysis, carry relevant information and the rest of this
signal has virtually no information. Therefore, all but the first 64 samples
can be discarded without any loss of information. This is how DWT provides a
very effective data reduction scheme.</p>

<p>Figure 4.2 Example of a DWT</p>

<p>We will revisit this example, since it provides important insight to how DWT
should be interpreted. Before that, however, we need to conclude our
mathematical analysis of the DWT. </p>

<p>One important property of the discrete wavelet transform is the relationship
between the impulse responses of the highpass and lowpass filters. The highpass
and lowpass filters are not independent of each other, and they are related by </p>

<p><img id="_x0000_i1031" src="Part4_files/Image7.gif" height="30" border="0" width="208"></p>

<p><span class="GramE">where</span> g[n] is the highpass, h[n] is the lowpass
filter, and L is the filter length (in number of points). Note that the two
filters are odd index alternated reversed versions of each other. Lowpass to
highpass conversion is provided by the (-1<span class="GramE">)<sup>n</sup></span>
term. Filters satisfying this condition are commonly used in signal processing,
and they are known as the <span class="SpellE">Quadrature</span> Mirror Filters
(QMF). The two filtering and <span class="SpellE">subsampling</span> operations
can be expressed by </p>

<p><img id="_x0000_i1032" src="Part4_files/Image8.gif" height="93" border="0" width="241"></p>

<p>The reconstruction in this case is very easy since <span class="SpellE">halfband</span>
filters form <span class="SpellE">orthonormal</span> bases. The above procedure
is followed in reverse order for the reconstruction. The signals at every level
are <span class="SpellE">upsampled</span> by two, passed through the synthesis
filters <span class="GramE">g�[</span>n], and h�[n] (highpass and lowpass,
respectively), and then added. The interesting point here is that the analysis
and synthesis filters are identical to each other, except for a time reversal.
Therefore, the reconstruction formula becomes (for each layer)</p>

<p><img id="_x0000_i1033" src="Part4_files/Image9.gif" height="56" border="0" width="436"></p>

<p>However, if the filters are not ideal <span class="SpellE">halfband</span>,
then perfect reconstruction cannot be achieved. Although it is not possible to
realize ideal filters, under certain conditions it is possible to find filters
that provide perfect reconstruction. The most famous ones are the ones
developed by Ingrid Daubechies, and they are known as Daubechies� wavelets. </p>

<p>Note that due to successive <span class="SpellE">subsampling</span> by 2, the
signal length must be a power of 2, or at least a multiple of power of 2, in
order this scheme to be efficient. The length of the signal determines the
number of levels that the signal can be decomposed to. For example, if the
signal length is 1024, ten levels of decomposition are possible. </p>

<p>Interpreting the DWT coefficients can sometimes be rather difficult because
the way DWT coefficients are presented is rather peculiar. To make a real long
story real short, DWT coefficients of each level are concatenated, starting
with the last level. An example is in order to make this concept clear: </p>

<p>Suppose we have a 256-sample long signal sampled at 10 MHZ and we wish to
obtain its DWT coefficients. Since the signal is sampled at 10 MHz, the highest
frequency component that exists in the signal is 5 MHz. At the first level, the
signal is passed through the lowpass filter h[n], and the highpass filter g[n],
the outputs of which are <span class="SpellE">subsampled</span> by two. The
highpass filter output is the first level DWT coefficients. There are 128 of
them, and they represent the signal in the [2.5 5] MHz range. These 128 samples
are the last 128 samples plotted. The lowpass filter output, which also has 128
samples, but spanning the frequency band of [0 2.5] MHz, are further decomposed
by passing them through the same h[n] and g[n]. The output of the second
highpass filter is the level 2 DWT coefficients and these 64 samples precede
the 128 level 1 coefficients in the plot. The output of the second lowpass
filter is further decomposed, once again by passing it through the filters h[n]
and g[n]. The output of the third highpass filter is the level 3 DWT <span class="SpellE">coefficiets</span>. These 32 samples precede the level 2 DWT
coefficients in the plot. </p>

<p>The procedure continues until only 1 DWT coefficient can be computed at
level 9. This one coefficient is the first to be plotted in the DWT plot. This
is followed by 2 level 8 coefficients, 4 level 7 coefficients, 8 level 6
coefficients, 16 level 5 coefficients, 32 level 4 coefficients, 64 level 3
coefficients, 128 level 2 coefficients and finally 256 level 1 coefficients.
Note that less and less number of samples is used at lower frequencies,
therefore, the time resolution decreases as frequency decreases, but since the
frequency interval also decreases at low frequencies, the frequency resolution
increases. Obviously, the first few coefficients would not carry a whole lot of
information, simply due to greatly reduced time resolution. To illustrate this
richly bizarre DWT representation let us take a look at a real world signal.
Our original signal is a 256-sample long ultrasonic signal, which was sampled
at 25 MHz. This signal was originally generated by using a 2.25 MHz <span class="GramE">transducer,</span> therefore the main spectral component of the
signal is at 2.25 MHz. The last 128 samples correspond to [6.25 12.5] MHz
range. As seen from the plot, no information is available <span class="GramE">here,</span>
hence these samples can be discarded without any loss of information. The
preceding 64 samples represent the signal in the [3.12 6.25] MHz range, which
also does not carry any significant information. The little glitches probably
correspond to the high frequency noise in the signal. The preceding 32 samples
represent the signal in the [1.5 3.1] MHz range. As you can see, the majority
of the signal�s energy is focused in these 32 samples, as we expected to see.
The previous 16 samples correspond to [0.75 1.5] MHz and the peaks that are
seen at this level probably represent the lower frequency envelope of the
signal. The previous samples probably do not carry any other significant
information. It is safe to say that we can get by with the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup>
level <span class="GramE">coefficients, that is</span> we can represent this 256
sample long signal with 16+32=48 samples, a significant data reduction which
would make your computer quite happy. </p>

<p>&nbsp;One area that has benefited the most from this particular property of
the wavelet transforms is image processing. As you may well know, images,
particularly high-resolution images, claim a lot of disk space. As a matter of
fact, if this tutorial is taking a long time to download, that is mostly
because of the images. DWT can be used to reduce the image size without losing
much of the resolution. Here is how: </p>

<p>For a given image, you can compute the DWT of, say each row, and discard all
values in the DWT that are less then a certain threshold. We then save only
those DWT coefficients that are above the threshold for each row, and when we
need to reconstruct the original image, we simply pad each row with as many
zeros as the number of discarded coefficients, and use the inverse DWT to
reconstruct each row of the original image. We can also analyze the image at
different frequency bands, and reconstruct the original image by using only the
coefficients that are of a particular band. I will try to put sample images
hopefully soon, to illustrate this point.</p>

<p>Another issue that is receiving more and more attention is carrying out the
decomposition (<span class="SpellE">subband</span> coding) not only on the
lowpass side but on both sides. <span class="GramE">In other words, zooming into
both low and high frequency bands of the signal separately.</span> This can be
visualized as having both sides of the tree structure of Figure 4.1. What
result is what is known as the <b>wavelet <span class="GramE">packages<span style="font-weight:normal">.</span></span></b> We will not discuss wavelet
packages in this here, since it is beyond the scope of this tutorial. Anyone
who is interested in wavelet <span class="GramE">packages,</span> or more
information on DWT can find this information in any of the numerous texts
available in the market.</p>

<p>And this concludes our mini series of wavelet tutorial. If I could be of any
assistance to anyone struggling to understand the wavelets, I would consider
the time and the effort that went into this tutorial well spent. I would like
to remind that this tutorial is neither a complete nor a through coverage of
the wavelet transforms. It is merely an overview of the concept of wavelets and
it was intended to serve as a first reference for those who find the available
texts on wavelets rather complicated. There might be many structural and/or
technical mistakes, and I would appreciate if you could point those out to me.
Your feedback is of utmost importance for the success of this tutorial. </p>
